#v0.1 is done
 - receives a simple array as data
 - can set bigframe height and width, color and border
 - chartLabel can set set font (color, size and type), as well no chartLabel
 - can set chart frame color and divisions in number of slices and type of slices (absolute or pencent) (Y axis division)
 - Y Axis can set fontSize
 - bar columns can set color and whether there is label (over, top, middle and bottom). In this case, the label will be the data received
 - also, barcolumn can have a offset from the chartLabel, i.e. the chartLabel has a maximum height of 1000 and the biggest data's number is, let's say, 759
    reason: the user wanna compare his/her data in another context, besides his/her data
 - X Axis can set month and start from any month that the system will fill the other labels
 - there is an option to a generic label for X Axis

  Next version(s):
    - adjust either vertical as horizontal barchart frame's position (consider the element after the frame, sucha as the labels)
    - receive multiple data's values and labels (plus legend and columns with multiple values diff by color)
    - figure out and format big digits to the X Axis labels or columns' labels
    - check auto fill for the xlabel besides months
    - review and organize better the code and functions

#v.03 is done
- v1 plus:
- it receives data as a SIMPLE ARRAY, an ARRAY OF OBJECTS (label for each numbers)
  and ARRAY OF ARRAY, which contais multiple numbers for each column, along with color and label (this data draws legend).
- no more XGeneral label
- X Axis can also receive number and increment (or decrement if -) the label's number
- central vertical and horizontal frame position is working fairly well

  Next version(s):
    - figure out and format big digits to the X Axis labels or columns' labels
    - check fontsizes and define better when to apply
    - review and organize better the code and functions
    - perform tests with differen settings
    - document
