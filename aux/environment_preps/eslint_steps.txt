1- inside VSCode, install ESLint extension
2- in my physical machine (not the vagrant), I had to install node and
 npm. After that, I installed ESLint by:
    sudo npm install -g eslint
3- afterwards, had to cset up the ESLint by:
    eslint --init

Now, the configuration is done but need to know how to use
 ESLint and the configuration about the editor seems not working.

Solution:
  1- add the extension editorconfig in VSCode
  2-  npm install -g editorconfig
  3- restart VSCode

Environment is done!
