# Improvements:
There is a function to adjust the fontsize within the element, and it's working to the labelChart element, but I wanted to apply to other elements,
such as the Y and X Axis labels, the legend and columns labels. This is one of the improvements.
Another improvement I wanted to work is to adjust bigger numbers to the columns width.
Also, I would like to figure out better the case of one more label for the Xs labels, such as year under the months.
The review of the code and the functions.
