 - the ideia is having a HTML page which has a form with all possible options to draw the chart


- Functional Requirements
You should have a simple API to draw a bar chart. The function should be used by your HTML page
 to render the chart into your demo page. The signature of the function should be as follows:

drawBarChart(data, options, element);

The data parameter will be the data the chart should work from Start with just an Array of numbers
e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The options parameter should be an object which has options for the chart.
e.g. width and height of the bar chart

The element parameter should be a DOM element or jQuery element that the chart will get rendered into.


STEPS:
- understand the order and the requirements
- understand better chart bars
- install, configure and run ESLint
- set GitHub
- understand JQuery
- CSS, HTML, JavaScript a little bit more
- build version 0.1 with simple possibilities
- increment the above one
