missing (at least):
 lines in the chart to give reference (50%, 25%, etc)
 options (color, size, set of values, labels, etc)
 element - where to place the chart
 (negative numbers (one more frame bellow?))


Need to learn:
 - JQuery
 - GitHub
 - ESLint
 - how to use CSS (CSS transitions and animations.)
 - how to draw using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript w/ jQuery (no Canvas or SVG)

 - the ideia is having a HTML page which has a form with all possible options to draw the chart


- Functional Requirements
You should have a simple API to draw a bar chart. The function should be used by your HTML page
 to render the chart into your demo page. The signature of the function should be as follows:

drawBarChart(data, options, element);

The data parameter will be the data the chart should work from Start with just an Array of numbers
e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The options parameter should be an object which has options for the chart.
e.g. width and height of the bar chart

The element parameter should be a DOM element or jQuery element that the chart will get rendered into.


STEPS:
- understand the order and the requirements
- understand better chart bars
- install, configure and run ESLint
- set GitHub
- understand JQuery
- CSS, HTML, JavaScript a little bit more
- build version 0.1 with simple possibilities
- increment the above one


v0.1 has to have:
  OK- receive a simple array as data
- OK chart settable (color, sizes, font-family, html, etc) many options available
  OK - arrows
  OK - y axis' label (divide the axis with lines)
    user says the number of divisions
    option as the divisions be percentage
- the char size has to be dynamic, regarding the size of the frame and the other elements such as labels (has to figure out better)
- OK create one label for each column and check if the width is bigger than the column (using vw)
- OK user saying the biggest value (apply it to absolute and percent)
- OK receive an array with label for each item. i.e. jan: 10, feb:15, mar:18, apr:20...
- what if the numbers are bigger than 3 digts?
- frame left position has to be adjustable (dynamic) (it can be done in the v.02 version)
-- chartlabel and bellow x (actually frame) may have 10% and frame will have 80% always (it's dynamic)
- OK have to understand better the fontSize properties to adjust the label in a good manner
-+- enable barchart label font (font family, size, bold, italic)
-+- barchart label and xGeneralLabel have to be dynamic if frame + barchartLabel + xGeneralLabel bigger than 100% bigFrame
-- need apply setFonSize for other labels
    Ylabel is okay, but it's related to the column width. It isn't the best way. Right now, okay
    OK Add a feature where user can change the fontSize by (him/her)self
- OK bigFrame sets backgroundColor and border
- OK frame sets color


missing numbers for OOA and missing all AO
AA is ready!
